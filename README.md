# MyFirstProject

This is just a short project for myself to get a better understanding of C#.
I'm putting together a console application for TicTacToe and practicing OOP, including Exception Handling, using Methods, and developing a simple AI to play against.
It's also my first time using github, so I wanted to use this project as a way to get a handle on this application as well.
